                This tool allows users to translate their EN mailers to other CLE languages in-place on stripo itself.<br>
                It allows for undo of most recent translation. <br>
                It includes CRUD operations for the translations.json file that contains the key and values for translation. <br>
                Adding keywords will be done via text input and Updating and Deleting will be done via a dropdown of the regex keywords that is being replaced/matched. <br>
                Highlighting selected keyword is available after text input or selection from dropdown. <br>
                Tool also allows for users to export their local translations.json. <br>
                NOTE:
                Recommended workflow is for users to overwrite the translations.json in the folder that contains the extension BEFORE distributing to other users to prevent any problems.
